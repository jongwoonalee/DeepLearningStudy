# 🧠 Deep Learning Study Notes

Welcome to my personal deep learning study repository!  
This space is dedicated to collecting and organizing high-quality, topic-specific insights from papers I read, especially in **digital pathology**, **MIL (Multiple Instance Learning)**, and **self-attention architectures**.

---

## 📂 Current Study: DA-MIL

### 🔍 Project: Divide-and-Aggregate MIL for WSI Classification

**Paper**:  
"DA-MIL: Divide-and-Aggregate Multiple Instance Learning for Hormone Receptor Status Classification from H&E WSIs"

**Focus**:
- Weakly-supervised WSI classification
- Bag-level vs patch-level attention
- Contrastive learning with pure-negative representation

**📄 Notes**: [DA-MIL_Study_Notes.md](./DA-MIL_Study_Notes.md)

## 🧩 Topics I’m Exploring

| Topic | Keywords |
|-------|----------|
| Digital Pathology | WSI, H&E, IHC, TILs |
| MIL Frameworks | CLAM, TransMIL, DA-MIL |
| Attention Mechanisms | Gated Attention, Self-Attention |
| Contrastive Learning | Prototype, instance-level, zL vs zN |
| Model Interpretability | Patch importance, heatmaps |

## 🚧 Future Plans

- [ ] Implement simplified DA-MIL pipeline in PyTorch
- [ ] Visualize attention heatmaps for TIL classification
- [ ] Build Obsidian-style markdown knowledge base
- [ ] Reorganize notes into Jupyter Book format
